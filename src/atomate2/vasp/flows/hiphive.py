    Workflow to calc. interatomic force constants and vibrational props using hiPhive.

    A summary of the workflow is as follows:
    1. Structure relaxtion
    2. Calculate a supercell transformation matrix that brings the
       structure as close as cubic as possible, with all lattice lengths
       greater than 5 nearest neighbor distances.
    3. Perturb the atomic sites for each supercell using a Monte Carlo
       rattle procedure. The atoms are perturbed roughly according to a
       normal deviation. A number of standard deviation perturbation distances
       are included. Multiple supercells may be generated for each perturbation
       distance.
    4. Run static VASP calculations on each perturbed supercell to calculate
       atomic forces.
    5. Aggregate the forces and conduct the fit atomic force constants using
       the minimization schemes in hiPhive.
    6. Output the interatomic force constants, and phonon band structure and
       density of states to the database.
    7. Optional: Perform phonon renormalization at finite temperature - useful
       when unstable modes exist
    8. Optional: Solve the lattice thermal conductivity using ShengBTE and
       output to the database.
